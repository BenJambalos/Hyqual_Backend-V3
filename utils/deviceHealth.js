// never something the device tells us. Instead every contact (status
// heartbeat, reading upload, config poll) stamps device_status.last_seen_at,
// and a device that has been silent for longer than OFFLINE_AFTER_SECONDS
// is OFFLINE. That is computed when the data is READ (see connectivitySql),
// so it is correct even if the server was restarted or no background job
// has run yet. A background sweep (sweepOfflineDevices) additionally keeps
// the stored value honest and raises one "Device Offline" notification.
